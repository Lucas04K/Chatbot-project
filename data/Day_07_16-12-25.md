## __Introduction__

In the morning, we once again discussed the process of publishing changes to GitHub and reviewed the sequence of actions involved, including the order of steps and commands when working with conflicting branches.

After successfully publishing the protocol, we moved on to an introduction to Python, which covered the following topics:

1. Overview of the Jupyter Notebook interface

2. Introduction to the main data types in Python

3. Introduction to arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators

4. Introduction to the concept of variables and working with variables

After the lecture part, we completed practical exercises focused on doing exercise with operators and variables.

## __Operators
* - arithmetic operators
    - Addition: \+
    - Subtraction: \-
    - Multiplication: \*	
    - Division: \/
    - Modulus: \%
    - Exponentiation: \**
    - Floor division: \//
- comparison operators
    - Equal: \==
    - Not equal: \!=
    - Greater than: \>
    - Less than: \<
    - Greater than or equal to: \>=
    - Less than or equal to: \<=
- Logical operators:
    - Returns True if both statements are true: and
    - Returns True if one of the statements is true: or
    - Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true: not

## __Variables
A variable can have any name as long as it follows the rules. Be creative but try to be as precise as possible! When naming things, please stick to these guidelines:
Separate words with the underscore character `_`
Case-sensitive: Salary and salary are two different variables, write everything in lowercase
Variable should have a descriptive name
Variables must not start with a number or symbol just letters
Left side of Equal is variable name  = Right side of Equals > value
To avoid this, you can either use double quotes for a string "" or write it like this "I did\'nt"
a = 8
b = "Hello"
c = a + b + 5


 

Thank you!
