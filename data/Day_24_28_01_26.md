## __Introduction__
Today’s session focused on the concept of confidence intervals to help quantify the uncertainty in sample estimates and give a sense of how close the sample statistic is likely to be to the true population value. We also tried something new: Reading the notes of the Code Along 01-06 to get a better grasp of the course materials. Thereafter, we resumed with the lesson.

## __Confidence Intervals__ 
Confidence Intervals (CIs) provide a range of values that is likely to include a population parameter with a certain level of confidence, typically 95%.

How to understand a Confidence Interval
- A confidence interval is not a guarantee
- It shows a range of possible values
- 95% confidence = 95 out of 100 intervals contain the true value
- It helps us understand uncertainty

## Key Concepts

- **Definition:**  
  A Confidence Interval is typically represented as:  

- **Estimate:** The sample statistic (e.g., sample mean or sample proportion)  
- **Margin of Error:** Accounts for sample variability; calculated using standard errors and critical values from statistical distributions.

- **Methods for calculating Margin of Error:**
- **Z-Distribution:**  
  Used for normal distributions where the population standard deviation is known or when the sample size is large (n > 30).  
- **T-Distribution:**  
  Used for normal distributions with unknown population standard deviation and small sample sizes (n < 30).

- **Alternative Method:**  
- **Bootstrapping:**  
  A resampling method where many samples are drawn from the data to estimate the CI. The more iterations, the more reliable the results.

- **Confidence level and range:**  
- Common confidence level: **95%** → 5% error range.  
- Higher confidence (e.g., 99%) → **wider range**, more certainty but less precision.

**Visual examples:**

**Confidence Interval**

Lower Bound        Sample Mean        Upper Bound
     |-------------------|-------------------|
                ↑
           Point Estimate


- The sample mean is the centre of the interval.
- The lower and upper bounds define the confidence interval.

**Effect of Confidence Level**
95% Confidence Interval:
     |-------------------------|

99% Confidence Interval:
  |---------------------------------|

- Higher confidence (99%) → wider interval → more certainty, less precision
- Lower confidence (90–95%) → narrower interval → less certainty, more precision

**Bootstrap Means Distribution**

      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
  ----|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|----
       2.5%               97.5%
- Many resampled means are generated from the original sample.
- The CI is defined using percentiles (e.g. 2.5% and 97.5%).
- More bootstrap samples → more stable and reliable interval.

## Lecture / Notes Highlights

- Pre-reading code-along notes to build baseline understanding.  
- Discussion: number of bootstrap iterations — more iterations = more reliable results.  
- 95% confidence is standard; 99% possible for higher certainty.  
- Sample statistics never match population exactly — CI helps account for this uncertainty.

Why Confidence Intervals help with decisions
- Confidence intervals help decide if a result is acceptable or risky
- We look at the lower and upper bounds
- If the upper bound crosses a limit → not safe
- Used in real projects and quality checks

## Code Along Overview Of Notebook 1 and 2 

### Notebook 1
- Calculate **sample mean vs true mean** to illustrate the need for CIs.  
- Create a dataset to mimic the population (e.g., ages).  
- Draw a random sample (size = 30).  
- Calculate sample mean and population mean.

### Notebook 2
- Investigate whether a sample can exactly match the population (usually not).  
- Sample calculations in Python:  
```python
sample_mean = np.mean(sample)
sample_std = np.std(sample, ddof=1)  sample standard deviation

## __Discussion Questions__

Q1. How many times do we bootstrap? 
A: As many times as you can. The more means you can accumulate, the better chance for accuracy. There’s no rule.The more you bootstrap, the more reliable results.
