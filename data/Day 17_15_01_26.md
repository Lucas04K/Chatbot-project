## __Introduction__  
Today’s session focused on descriptive and inferential statistics, exploring different types of variables, measures of central tendency and dispersion, as well as visualization techniques. A penguins dataset from a previous lesson was used as a reference example to illustrate statistical concepts and plotting, but the focus of today’s lecture was on understanding statistical principles rather than the dataset itself.<br>

Statistics in data analysis were presented in two main categories: Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics.<br>

## __Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics__  

**Descriptive Statistics** summarize the main characteristics of a dataset without losing important information.<br>
- Measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode  <br>
- Measures of dispersion: range, variance, standard deviation, IQR  <br>
- Uses visual tools such as histograms and boxplots  <br>

**Inferential Statistics** 
use sample data to draw conclusions or make predictions about a population.  <br> 
- Based on probability theory  <br>
- Allows generalization from a sample to a population  <br>

---

## __Population vs Sample__  

- **Population:** The entire group under study (e.g., all students at a university)  <br>
- **Sample:** A subset of the population used for analysis  <br>
- The sample must be representative to allow valid conclusions  <br>

---

## __Types of Variables__  

**Categorical / Qualitative Variables**  
- **Nominal:** Categories without natural order (cities, nationalities, brands)<br>
- **Ordinal:** Ordered categories with unequal spacing (ratings, performance levels)  <br>

**Numeric / Quantitative Variables**  
- **Continuous:** Can take any value within a range (height, weight, time)  <br>
- **Discrete:** Countable values (number of books, number of rainy days)  <br>

---

## __Measures of Central Tendency__  

- **Mean:** The arithmetic average of all values; sensitive to outliers  <br>
- **Median:** The middle value after sorting the data; resistant to outliers  <br>
- **Mode:** The most frequent value; useful for categorical data  <br>

**Python commands used:**  
```python
data.mean()
data.median()
data.mode()
````

Rule related to outliers:

If Median < Mean → presence of very large values<br>

If Median > Mean → presence of very small values<br>


## __Measures of Dispersion__

**Range**

The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.<br>

Formula:
Range = Max − Min <br>

Explanation:

- Gives a quick overview of how spread out the data is Very simple to calculate <br>

- Highly sensitive to extreme values (outliers) <br>

- Does not describe how values are distributed between the minimum and maximum <br>

Example:


    data_list = [1, 4, 5, 12, 100, 180, 200]

    Max = 200 

    Min = 1 

    Range = 200 − 1 = 199



This shows that the data values span a wide interval, but it does not tell us how the values are distributed within that range. <br>



## __Variance__

Variance measures how much data values spread around the mean.
It is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean.
A small variance means values are close to the mean, while a large variance means they are widely spread. <br>

Variance is important because it forms the basis of the standard deviation. <br>


## __Standard Deviation (Population)__


``sigma = sqrt( sum( (xi - mu)^2 ) / N )`` <br>

sigma = population standard deviation <br>
xi = data value <br>
mu = population mean <br>
N = number of observations <br>

e.g. `penguins['body_mass_g'].std()`  

- **Note:**

Standard deviation measures how far values are from the mean. <br>

Larger values indicate more spread in the data. <br>


## __Quantiles__

Quantiles divide the data into equal parts. <br>

- Q1: 25% of the data lies below this value <br>

- Q2 (Median): 50% of the data lies below this value <br>

- Q3: 75% of the data lies below this value <br>

- Interquartile Range (IQR): <br>

    IQR = Q3 − Q1 <br> 
    Used to describe spread and detect outliers. <br>

- Outlier Detection Example: <br>

```
data_list = [1, 4, 5, 12, 100, 180, 200]

    Q1 = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5

    Q2 (Median) = 12

    Q3 = (100 + 180) / 2 = 140

    IQR = Q3 − Q1 = 135.5

    Lower Bound:
    LB = Q1 − 1.5 × IQR = −198.75

    Upper Bound:
    UB = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR = 343.25
````



Conclusion: "There are no outliers in this dataset"


## __Correlation__

- Measures the linear relationship between two variables (range: −1 to 1) <br>

- Pearson correlation measures linear dependence <br>

- Visualized using heatmaps or correlation matrices <br>

**Important note**: correlation ≠ causation <br>

Example command: <br>

`corr_matrix = data_var.corr(method='pearson')` <br>



**Key Takeaways**

- Descriptive statistics summarize existing data <br>

- Inferential statistics allow conclusions about a population <br>

- The range provides a quick but limited measure of spread <br>

- Standard deviation and IQR offer deeper insight into dispersion <br>

- Understanding variable types is essential for correct analysis <br>
