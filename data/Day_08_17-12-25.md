# Day 8, 17.12.2025
Protocol writer: Lisa

## __Introduction__
We started the morning with a career course repetition of last week's introduction and collaborated on the protocol for day 7. Then we got introduced to Strings and the many different built-in methods to handle them and did a group exercise on them. We spent the afternoon first discussing the exercise solution, then solving various git/VSCode issues and discussing protocol process (to be continued tomorrow).

Main topics of the day: Strings, git process for daily protocol & exercises 

Next protocol writer for day 9: Gabriela

## __Strings__ 
* Some important commands
    * adding \n to start a new line in a string (important: no space after the character)
    * if you use ''' (3 single quotes) to wrap your text, it means you can add formatted multi-line text, it will recognize the line breaks you have made
* using **f strings** to include variables when printing strings
* **concatenating** strings
* **slicing** strings and using indexes to access separate items [characters] of the sliced up string
* accessing string characters by using an index (important: python is a zero-indexed language, meaning index starts at 0)
* String methods
    * .upper() converts a string to uppercase
    * .lower() converts a string to lowercase
    * .strip() removes whitspace from beginning and end of a string
    * .replace(old, new) replaces all occurences of the old substring with new
    * .split(separator) divides a string into a list where each word is a list item
    * .capitalize() capitalizes the first word


## __User Input__
* input() asks the user to enter an input and converts it into a string 
    * be aware it is _always_ saved as a string, if you need a different data type, you need to transform it - **typecasting** int(input())
    * input() triggers a pop-up window that user needs to fill to continue running the code
* for user output, use print() like we've learned

## __Protocol Process__
### __Locally/in VSCode__
* Open .md file for existing day or create a new one: Day_[number]_[DD-MM-YY]
* Open repo da-daily-protocol..
* Check if you are in your own branch and NOT in main (command "git branch" lists the branches, the highlighted one is the one you are in)
    * If you're in main, change into your own branch with "git checkout [your_branch_name]"
* Write protocol
* Save changes (CTRL+S on Windows or CMD+S)
* Next day: meet at 9 (Wednesdays: 11:30!) to collaborate on protocol
* Save changes (CTRL+S on Windows or CMD+S)
* Use command: "git add ." to stage files
* Use command: "git commit -m '[commit_message]"
* Use command: "git push" to push changes to your branch
* Switch to github.com and create a pull request (green button)
    * explain your changes in the PR message
    * choose 2 reviewers
    * for reviewers: review changes, choose "comment", "approve" or "request changes"
* after both reviewers approve PR, merge it (green button on the bottom of the PR on github.com)

* When it's your turn again to write the protocol and you want to work locally on the same branch, you need to do the following steps before you can push your new protocol
    * switch to the main branch
    * git pull from the main branch
    * switch to your own branch again
    * merge main into your own branch

## __Process for daily exercises__
Save your exercises and keep input from Merna up-to-date

### __Upload your exercises to your own branch (never to main!)__
* Work on exercises locally 
    * Student creates branch (needs to happen only once) (git branch [name_own_branch])
    * Student stands on feature branch locally (git checkout [name_own_branch])
    * Student works on exercises in VSCode editors space
    * Student saves work in feature branch
       * save changes locally
       * stage files (git add .)
       * commit changes to your branch (git commit -m '[commit_message]')
* Update exercises to our fork (never to the original repo, only Merna works on that)
    * Student updates remote repo (git push -u origin)

### __Get Merna's updates to Code Along files into your VSCode__
* Merna works on code along
* Merna pushes to neuefische repo main
    * For the first time: Student forks (creates their own copy of the original repo on github) 
    * After first time: go to GitHub
      * go to your fork (which you can recognize by [your git hub name]/da-da-081225-python-module
      * click "sync fork" button to sync Merna's changes
* Get updates locally
   * go back to VSCode
      * go to your main (git checkout main)
      * pull changes to main (git pull)
      * go to your own branch (git checkout [name_own_branch])
      * merge files from main into your solutions branch (git merge main)
