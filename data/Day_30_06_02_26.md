## __Topics in session__ 

## Cloud Databases & Data Centers

We started with a short warm-up about **data centers**: they are physical facilities that host powerful servers used to run company services (storing data, hosting websites/apps, and processing requests). Many companies **rent data center/cloud services** from providers like AWS or Google Cloud instead of building their own, mainly to avoid the high costs of buying hardware, maintaining it, and running it.

We also discussed what a data center needs to work well: **large space**, **reliable electricity**, **strong cooling systems**, **high-bandwidth internet connectivity (fiber links)**, and **strong physical security**. Finally, we talked about why an old submarine bunker location can be ideal (good connectivity, security, stable environment, and access to power).

### Why use a database in the cloud?
Cloud databases offer:
- **Easy administration** and fast setup/teardown  
- **Faster time-to-market** (no waiting for hardware/network setup)  
- **Reduced risk** (security + backups + recovery options)  
- **Scalability** (grow/shrink as needed)  
- **Accessibility** (reach from anywhere with permissions)  
- **Lower costs** compared to owning and operating everything yourself


## What is a Cloud & a Cloud Service Provider?

A **cloud** is basically a way to use computing resources (servers, storage, networking, software) **over the internet**, instead of owning and running everything on your own machine. The key idea is that the resources are available **24/7**, can be accessed from anywhere, and can scale up/down depending on demand.

A **Cloud Service Provider (CSP)** is a company that owns and operates this infrastructure and offers it to customers **on demand**. Customers usually pay only for what they use (pay-as-you-go). Examples include **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, and **Microsoft Azure**.

**Typical benefits of cloud computing:**
- **Scalability & flexibility** (scale up/down quickly)
- **Pay-as-you-go cost model**
- **Automatic updates & easier maintenance**
- **Collaboration & accessibility from anywhere**
- **Security + backup + disaster recovery options**
- **Location independence** (work globally)


## What is a Cloud Database?

A **cloud database** is a database that runs on cloud infrastructure and is provided as a managed service by a cloud provider. Instead of you installing and maintaining the database on your own server, the provider hosts it and handles most of the operational work.

**Why companies use cloud databases:**
- Access the database **remotely from anywhere** (with authentication)
- Less operational effort (no hardware setup, less maintenance)
- Often **faster to deploy** and **cheaper** than running your own database server
- Built-in options for **scaling, backups, monitoring, and reliability**


**SQL vs NoSQL (Quick Notes)**

#### ✅ SQL (Relational Databases)
- Data is stored in **tables** (rows & columns).
- Uses **predefined relationships** between tables (schema + keys).
- Great for **complex querying** (e.g., joins across multiple tables).
- Supports **constraints** to keep data consistent and clean.
- Best when data is **structured** and relationships are important.  
  **Examples:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle

---

#### ✅ NoSQL (Not Only SQL)
- Data can be stored in **flexible formats** (documents, key-value, graph, wide-column).
- Often **schema-less**, so it’s easier to handle changing data structures.
- Usually scales well horizontally and can be optimized for **low-latency** access patterns.
- Best when you need **flexibility + scalability** or access patterns are simple/known.  
  **Examples:** MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase, DynamoDB

---

#### ⭐ Quick takeaway
- **SQL:** structured data + relationships + strong integrity  
- **NoSQL:** flexible data + scalability + fast access for specific patterns

---

#### Other database types 
- **Hierarchical DB:** parent–child (tree-like) structure  
- **Network DB:** more complex many-to-many connections  
- **Object-Oriented DB:** stores data as objects (OOP style)


### RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)
- **RDBMS** is software used to **create, read, update, and manage** data in a *relational* database.
- We interact with it mainly through **SQL** (to query and manipulate data).
- Common examples: **PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server**.
- In this course we use **PostgreSQL** (popular, powerful, and open-source).

---

### Database Server (Client–Server idea)
- A **database server** is a machine/service that **runs the DBMS** and hosts the databases.
- Users connect to it using a **client** application.

**To connect to a database server you typically need:**
- Host / IP (or endpoint)  
- Username  
- Password  
- Port number  
- Database name  

---

### Port (Computer/Server Port)
- A **port** is like a “door number” that tells the network **which service** you want to reach on a machine.
- Examples: HTTP usually uses **80**, HTTPS uses **443**.
- For **PostgreSQL**, the default port is **5432**.

---

### Database Client
- A **client** is the tool you use to connect and work with the database (run SQL, browse tables, etc.).
- Examples:
  - **CLI**: `psql`
  - **GUI**: **DBeaver**, **pgAdmin**
- Clients use the same connection details (host, user, password, port, db name).

---

### Database vs Data Warehouse vs Data Lake
#### Database
- Built for **day-to-day operations** (transactions): insert/update/select quickly.
- Data is usually **structured** and normalized (tables + relationships).

#### Data Warehouse
- Built for **analytics & reporting** (BI): fast queries on historical data.
- Stores **structured, cleaned, pre-processed** data (often from multiple sources).
- Think: “ready for analysis” (e.g., monthly sales summary tables).

#### Data Lake
- Stores **raw data** in many formats:


## DBeaver

### Overview (Server–Client Model)
PostgreSQL uses a **server–client** architecture: the **server** hosts and manages databases (storage, security, query processing), while a **client** connects to send **SQL queries** and receive results.

**Common PostgreSQL clients:**  
- **psql** — command line  
- **pgAdmin** — GUI admin tool  
- **DBeaver** — universal DB GUI  
- **DataGrip** — JetBrains DB IDE  
- **Tableau** — BI tool (can connect to PostgreSQL)

### SQL Client / Database IDE (Quick Notes)
A **SQL client / Database IDE** helps you:
- connect to databases (local or cloud),
- write & run SQL,
- browse tables and results,
- and sometimes visualize/export data.

### Connecting to PostgreSQL on AWS (via DBeaver)
Typical connection details:
- **Host**: `data-analytics-course-2.c8g8r1deus2v.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
- **Port**: `5432`
- **Database**: `cohort_name`
- **Username / Password**: shared privately (Discord)


SQL – Quick Start in DBeaver (Basics)
Core idea

Use SQL to retrieve data from tables, control the output, and make results readable (select columns, limit rows, sort, remove duplicates, format text).

Basic pattern
SELECT select_list
FROM table_name
-- optional:
WHERE condition
ORDER BY sort_expression
LIMIT n;

Commands & Why we use them
1) SELECT ... FROM ... (retrieve data)

What it does: Returns rows/columns from a table.
Why we use it: The foundation of SQL: “get these columns from this table.”

SELECT *
FROM airports;

2)  (all columns) *

What it does: * means “all columns”.
Why we use it: Fast exploration when you want to inspect the full table quickly.

SELECT *
FROM airports;

3) Selecting specific columns (only what you need)

What it does: Returns only the columns you list.
Why we use it: Cleaner output + often faster + easier to read.

SELECT name, city, country
FROM airports;

4) ; (semicolon = end of statement)

What it does: Separates multiple SQL statements in the same script.
Why we use it: Lets you run multiple queries in one file safely.

SELECT * FROM airports LIMIT 5;
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM airports;

5) Comments (notes inside your SQL file) -

What it does: Adds text that is not executed.
Why we use it: Document queries + keep notes inside the script.

Single-line:

-- this is a comment


Multi-line:

/* this is
   a multi-line comment */

6) LIMIT (preview the first N rows)

What it does: Restricts the number of returned rows.
Why we use it: Quick preview (similar to head() in pandas).

SELECT *
FROM airports
LIMIT 5;

7) ORDER BY (sort results)

What it does: Sorts output by one or more columns.
Why we use it: Helps you inspect patterns and makes results easier to read.

SELECT name, city, country
FROM airports
ORDER BY country, city;


ASC vs DESC

ASC = ascending (default)

DESC = descending

SELECT name, city, country
FROM airports
ORDER BY country DESC;

8) DISTINCT (remove duplicates)

What it does: Returns only unique values (no duplicates).
Why we use it: Explore categories (e.g., “which countries exist?”).

SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM airports;

9) UPPER() (string function – uppercase)

What it does: Converts text to uppercase.
Why we use it: Formatting + standardizing output.

SELECT name, city, UPPER(country) AS country_upper
FROM airports;

10) AS (alias = rename output column)

What it does: Renames a column only in the result output (does not change the table).
Why we use it: Makes results clearer, especially with functions/calculations.

SELECT UPPER(country) AS country_upper
FROM airports;

Running these queries in DBeaver (fast workflow)

Put the cursor inside a query → Ctrl + Enter (runs current statement)

Highlight a block → Ctrl + Enter (runs selection)

Use ; to separate multiple statements in the same script

Mini takeaways

Everything after SELECT is what you’ll see in the output.

Use LIMIT for quick previews it is like head in pandas (Show the desired rows).

Use ORDER BY to sort and inspect patterns.

Use DISTINCT to discover unique values.

Use functions + AS(alias = rename output column) to format and clarify results.
