# Day 11, 5.12.2026  
Protocol writer: Tracey

## __Introduction__
We wrote the protocol in the morning.  
Merna asked if there were any comments we wanted to address, then moved into the lesson on Dictionaries.

We did a recap of the curriculum and confirmed that the protocol will be skipped during the Disney project.  
We then started with Python dictionary functions and were given an exercise to work on, reviewing concepts from previous exercises.

Afterwards, we split into groups to complete the exercise.  
After lunch, we reconvened and reviewed the exercise together as a group.

## __Dictionaries__ 

### Basics
* Curly braces `{}`  
* Store data as key–value pairs separeted alway with ** : **.
* Common methods: `.values()`, `.items()`, `.keys()`, `.get()`, `.update()`  '.pop()', '.clear()'
* * Can be nested

### Storing information with dictionaries
When working with tables or structured data, dictionaries are useful for assigning values to specific categories or entities.

* So far, we have learned that lists can store values like:
    ['alice', 234, 'emily', 387, 'madison', 103]
    However, this makes it difficult to assign values to a specific person or category.

* Dictionaries store data as **value pairs**, for example:
{'alice': 234, 'bob': 31, 'sandy': 45}
  
    *Keys: A key needs to be an immutable data type (e.g. string, int, float, boolean, tuples). It can NOT be a mutable type like a dictionary, list, or set.
    
    *Values: A value can be any data type, including lists and dictionaries (which leads to nested dictionaries).

In other words, one element is assigned to another and grouped into pairs.

We can use lists within a dictionary to group multiple values of the same type that will be assigned to the same key (one-to-many relationship). Example: key could be "hobbies" and the value could be a list that contains "reading" and "knitting"
---

### Accessing elements
* Values can be accessed using square brackets:
    babynames_frequency['anna']
* Note: in Lists [] are used to adresses indices and in dictionaries [] are used to adress values.
  
* [' '] > Access value using a key OR > To add something to a dictionary > Add a new key-value pair > Update existing value > Remove a key-value pair > Access nested dictionary value > Access value inside list in dict >
The dictionary then returns the associated value. Notice that if we tried to find a key that wasn't already in the dictionary with `[]` indexing, we get a `KeyError` telling us that that key is not stored in the dictionary.


* BUT This will raise an error if the key does not exist.
* INSTEAD, use the `.get()` method:  
    babynames_frequency.get('anna', 'not found')
    babynames_frequency.get('anna')  
ALSO, 
* `.get()` can be used for **data cleaning**
* One cannot retrieve two values at once

---

### Creating or updating key–value pairs
* To add a new key or update an existing one:
    babynames_frequency['peter'] = 124
* Updated dictionary should look like this:
    {'alice': 234, 'bob': 31, 'sandy': 45, 'peter': 124}

---

### Checking whether a key exists
* Using `in`, in > Check if key exists:
if 'bob' in babynames_frequency:
print('bob is there')

* Using `.get()`, return default value if key doesn’t exist:
if babynames_frequency.get('bob'):
print('bob is there')


---

### Number of elements in a dictionary
To check how many elements are in a dictionary:
len(babynames_frequency)

---

### Merging dictionaries
To merge two dictionaries, use:
.update()

---

### Calculating averages
Example:
sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)

---

### Nested dictionaries and raw data
Dictionaries are often used to store **raw, unprocessed data**, such as data received from a web scraper.

This data can be complex and often requires **nested dictionaries** to represent it correctly.

Different value types (strings, integers, lists) can be combined within a dictionary.  
This is known as a **nested dictionary** and is useful when one key is assigned multiple values (e.g. name, address, age, phone number).

Example:
user_info['John']['address'][0]

---

### Additional notes
* Previously, dictionaries in Python were **not ordered**, which is why `.pop()` requires a key
* `del` is a high-access keyword that clears memory  
  → using `del` can remove entire dictionaries or keys  
  → `.pop()` is safer when removing specific elements
* If you have a table with three columns, it can be stored using **three sets of keys**

## __Discussion Questions__

### Q1. Discuss the solution of Exercise 4 from the Dictionary exercise
There are multiple possible solutions to this exercise.  
Alina’s solution was the most complete and accurate.

She used `.append()`, however `.append()` cannot be used directly with dictionaries.

The exercise question that asks for writing a loop contains a mistake and should be ignored.

To remove an element from the database, the following approach was discussed:
database['Name'][0]
database['Date'][0]
database['Hours'][0]
database['Money'][0]

(Merna pushed the answer to git under "adding dictionaries solution": )

---

### Q2. Is list comprehension going to be covered?
List comprehension will be covered once loops have been fully introduced and mastered.
