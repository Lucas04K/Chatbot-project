## __Introduction__
The goal of Data Visualization is to bridge the gap between raw numbers and human understanding. It is not just about creating aesthetically pleasing shapes or charts; it is about transforming complex, multi-dimensional data into clear visual stories. This process enables stakeholders to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies at a glance, leading to more accurate, data-driven decision-making.

## __Visualization Strategy: Types of Diagrams__ 

* Pandas allows us to visualize data easily using different types of diagrams to represent various insights. However, before exploring the types of charts, we must ensure that the environment is ready by activating Conda and installing the Matplotlib package via the terminal using these commands:

*conda activate your_env_name*
*pip install matplotlib*

* You can use the following keyword arguments in the *.plot(kind='...')* function to choose the right chart:
* bar or barh (Bar Plots):
  * Usage: Used for Comparison between different categories. bar is vertical, while barh is horizontal.
* hist (Histogram):
  * Usage: Used to visualize the Distribution and frequency of a single continuous variable.
* box (Boxplot):
  * Usage: Essential for identifying Outliers and understanding the spread and scale of the data.
* kde or density (Density Plots):
  * Usage: Provides a smoothed curve to show the Probability Density of the data.
* area (Area Plots):
  * Usage: Used to represent accumulated totals over categories.
* scatter (Scatter Plots):
  * Usage: Used to find the Correlation or relationship between two numerical variables (X vs Y).
* hexbin (Hexagonal Bin Plots):
  * Usage: A powerful alternative to scatter plots for Large Datasets to show density.
* pie (Pie Plots):
  * Usage: Used to show the Proportion of categories within a whole.

## __Learning Objectives__ 
* Data Integrity: Ensuring data is clean and correct before visualization.
* Variable Identification: Distinguishing between Several Inputs (Features) and Outputs (Target labels).
* Standardization: Using consistent scales, colors, and sizes to avoid distracting the reader.
* Pandas Plotting: Mastering the .plot() function to generate quick and efficient insights.

## __Data (The Preparation Phase)__ 
* Before plotting, we must ensure the data is ready:
__Reading the Dataset__

* import pandas as pd
 *df = pd.read_csv('data/winequality-red.csv', delimiter=';')*
 Using delimiter ';' because the Red Wine dataset is not comma-separated

 ## __Inspecting & Cleaning__ 

* df.head(): Preview the first few rows.

* df.columns: Used to view the column names. This is essential to ensure we type the names correctly when calling them for analysis or when we need to modify them.

* df.info(): Check data types and missing values.

* df.describe(): Get statistical summaries (Mean, Min, Max, Quartiles).

## __Diagram Types and Implementation__ 

* Below are the practical implementations of various diagrams and the insights they provide:
* df['quality'].plot(kind='hist')

* Representation: A Histogram of the 'quality' column.

* Usage: Used to see the frequency distribution of wine quality scores to understand which quality rating is most common.
* df.plot(kind='scatter', x='total sulfur dioxide', y='free sulfur dioxide');

* Representation: A Scatter plot between two related inputs.

* Usage: Used to observe the correlation between total and free sulfur dioxide. The semicolon at the end suppresses unnecessary text output.

* df.plot(kind='scatter', x='quality', y='alcohol');

* Representation: A Scatter plot between an Output (quality) and an Input (alcohol).

* Usage: Used to analyze if alcohol content relates to quality rating.

* df.plot(kind='box', rot=90);

* Representation: A Boxplot for the entire dataset. 

* Usage: Used to detect outliers across all variables. rot=90 rotates the x-axis labels for better readability.

* df[['fixed acidity', 'pH', 'alcohol']].plot(kind='box')

* Representation: A filtered Boxplot for specific columns.

* Usage: Used to compare variables that have a relatively similar scale to better visualize their distributions.

* df[['fixed acidity', 'alcohol']].plot(kind='box');

* Representation: A Boxplot focusing on two specific variables .

* Usage: Provides a clearer comparison of the spread and median between acidity and alcohol levels.

* Data Understanding & Scaling:

* Inputs vs. Outputs: In our dataset, chemical parameters are Inputs (Independent Variables), while 'quality' is the Output (Dependent Variable). Understanding this relationship is crucial for selecting the correct visualization.

* Scaling Matters: Always ensure features are on a comparable Scale when plotting together. Improper scaling can obscure trends in smaller variables and lead to incorrect conclusions. 

## __Matplotlib: Advanced Customization__

* The core of the library is matplotlib.pyplot as plt. 
* To install it, you should run the following command in your terminal:
   pip install matplotlib

* Matplot can be imported with  one of theses two functions this should be done every time we need to use matplotlib

* import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Or with the function below
* from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

## __Differtnet functions__

* print(plt.style.available) for checking available styles 

* plt.style.use('style name') for using the style name 

* plt.figure(figsize=(10, 2))  10 is the diagram width , 2 is the height 

* plt.plot(x_vals, y_vals, label='Line 1') for labeling the x series 

* plt.legend() for adding legend 

* plt.plot(x, y, label='Example Dataset') for x labeling 

* plt.title('Example Plot') Diagram title 

* plt.xlabel('X-axis Label') or plt.ylabel('Y-axis Label') fpr axis label 

* plt.annotate('Important Point', xy=(x_point, y_point), xytext=(x_text, y_text),
             arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black', shrink=0.05))   xy represents the coordinates for the arrow , xytext where the text starts  ... arrowprops this defines the color and the width of the arrow .
        

* plt.xlim(0, 10) or plt.ylim(0, 20) for axis limits 

* plt.savefig('./line_plot_annotated.png') for data saving as pic png 

* plt.scatter(x_vals, y_vals, marker='v') blotting points with v shape 

* plt.scatter(x_vals, y_vals_2, marker='o') blotting points with o shape 

* Colors for the bars opr scatter diagram  can be done with two ways :
For bar  plt.bar(x_vals, y_vals, color='green') or plt.bar(x_vals, y_vals, color="#73987e")  # Using hex color code 
For scatter   plt.scatter(x_vals, y_vals, color='green')  # Using hex color code
            plt.scatter(x_vals, y_vals, color="#73987e") # Using hex color code



* plt.bar(x_vals, y_vals, color=['green', 'blue'])  we can choose colors for sets as shown in bar diagram  



* colors = ['green' if val > 25 else 'red' for val in y_vals] we can make a condition to show colors depending on values in the set 

* For bar width we can use that function as the width is 0.1
  plt.bar(x_vals, y_vals, width=0.1)

* plt.scatter(x_vals, y_vals, s=300)  s here is the size of the scattered point  and it can be adjusted 


* plt.plot(x_vals, y_vals, linewidth=5) for line thickness can be adjusted in the plot diagram
