# Day 12, 19.12.2025
Protocol writer: Marzie

## __Introduction__
We started with the daily protocol. Since Tracey (the protocol writer for the 5th of january) has not received her rental laptop from neue fische yet, she could not edit her protocol stressfree, considering her struggles with lagging on her current computer. Marzie tried to type instead but our discussion took longer than our schedule. Thus she invited us all as reviewers and we are asked to add our points to the protocol for **dictionaries** after the course.

## __for Loop__ 
### __usage__

* It is useful when you have a finite collection or a specific range and known numbers of steps.
* In plain words we are asking python: "FOR each item in this list, DO this or that thing"

* Without a loop we have to do a same code again and again! tedious and time consuming!

### loop through a list:
```  
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

Note: your variable name(s) can not be identical with your collection.
Note: your variable name(s) should be changed in the next set of code, otherwise your variable name will be rewritten. Unless you want to rewrite them.

### loop through numbers:
```
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
remember: "The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number." 

**OR** you can use this syntax:
range(start, stop, step)
list[start:stop:step]

### loop through a string:

```
name = "mesopotamien"

for letter in name:
    print(letter)
```

* enumerate() helps to loop through a list and ask for the index for each item.
* Use enumerate() when you want an extra label or counter.


### loop through a dictionary:
```
course_details = {'subject':'python', 'place':'online', 'population':'15'}

for label in course_details:
    print(f'{label}:{course_details[label]}')
```
### doing math on each item:
```
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]

for x in numbers:
    squared = x ** 2
    print(f'{x} squared is {squared}')
```
### counting and summing:
```
numbers = [10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
total = 0

for num in numbers:
    total += num
 print(total)
```
Note: the print(total) is not *indented*. This means Python waits until the entire loop is finished before printing the final result. If print(total) is indented, you would become a complete different result!

### zip()
* The zip() function joins (zips) together two or more items from different lists. It will create tuples that can be indexed together.
* When lists have different lengths, zip stops at the shortest one.
Any extra elements in the longer lists are ignored.

### time.sleep() inside for_loop

* you need to:
```
import time
```
* In Python, time.sleep() is like hitting a pause button for your code.
```
for snoozing in range(5):
    print(snoozing)
    print("You are doing a great job with python!")
    time.sleep(2)
```
## __while loop
### __usage__
* While loop comes handy when the number of repeats depends on **something changing** inside the loop and it is not clear at the beginning how many times the loop will run. While_loop is useful among others for 'waiting for user input', 'getting validation', 'game loops'.

**example**
```
i = 0

while i < 10:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
```
* the while loop requires defined variables to work with.

Note: 'i = i + 1' is incrementing our variable 'i'. Without this the loop will continue for ever because the *i* stays 0 forever and would not reach 10! 
With this line we are telling python to take the current number of *i*, add 1 to it, and put the new number back in the "box" of *i*! 

Note: increment: i = i + 1  -----> i += 1, decrement: i = i - 1 -----> i -= 1

### __break, continue and pass__

* the break statement stops the loop permanently, as soon as a certain condition is met. The code jumps straight to the next line after the loop.
**example**
```
i = 1

while i < 6:
    print(i)
    if i == 3:
        break
    i += 1 
```
* the continue statement skips the rest of the loop, goes back to the top and starts with the next item. It is useful for blocking invalid data!
**example**
```
i = 0

while i < 5:
    i += 1
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
```
* the pass statement is just a placeholder to allow the code to run even with a part of it missing (e.g. if you still have to write the code for an if statement or loop but you want to check the rest of the code)

### Nested loops
To help you visualize this, imagine a clock:

The Hour hand is the Outer Loop. It moves slowly.

The Minute hand is the Inner Loop. It must complete a full circle (60 minutes) before the hour hand can move just one notch.

How it Works
The Outer Loop starts its first "lap."

While the outer loop is on its first lap, the Inner Loop starts and runs until it is completely finished.

Once the inner loop is done, the outer loop moves to its second "lap."

The inner loop starts all over again from the beginning.
